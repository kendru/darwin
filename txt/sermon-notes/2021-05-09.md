- There is a distinction between I/Thee and I/It relationships (ref?)
  - Every human being deserves to be seen as a person, not a tool.
  - Every person deserves to be seen as a whole person, not reduced.
- The Bible uses a master/servant analogy in many places
  - But Jesus says, "you are no longer servants, but now I call you friends."
  - In OT, only Abraham and Moses are called friends of God.
  - Unlike servants, we _know_ God, his heart, and his plan.
- What does this mean for us?
  1. God has been honest with us about _who He is_. He has revealed himself fully in the person of Jesus christ. When we see Jesus, we see the Father.
  2. We can be transparent without being vulnerable. In Jesus, God himself became vulnerable. Vulnerability opens up to pain and rejection. Jesus suffered pain and rejection, even among his own people.
- As we trust God's transparency with us, we can be transparent with others. As we trust God's vulnerability with us, we can be vulnerable with others. This is what love is.

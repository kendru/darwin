# Systemic Racism

### Definition of Racism

Racism is often defined in such a way that it encompasses both the prejudicial actions of specific persons as well as participation in the systems that have been put in place for the benefit of one race at the expense of another. For example, Tisby formulates the following definition: "Racism can operate through impersonal systems and not simply through the malicious words and actions of individuals"[p16][bib:tisby2019]

# Iteration And Feedback

The primary goal with any iterative process is to *maximize the information* gathered
per unit time of the feedback cycle. The two ways to achieve this goal are by shortening
the feedback cycle itself and by maximizing the amount of information gathered per
cycle.

- Shortening the cycle has the additional benefit that more recent information is more
likely to still be correct compared with less recent information.
- Sometimes it is not practical to further shorten the cycle, in which case gathering
more information per cycle is the best option.
- More data points per cycle != more information. Information must be interpretable
in a way that is relevant to the task at hand.

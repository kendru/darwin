# Christological NT Interpretation of OT Prophecies

In my reading through Matthew, I was reminded of one of the most fascinating OT references in all of the gospels: "This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, 'Out of Egypt I have called my son.'"[^1] This is a clear reference to Hosea 11:1, which reads, "When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son."[^2] However, in the context of Hosea, this passage appears to be a historical account of the exodus rather than a prophetic pronouncement.` This appears to be a very clear example of the NT authors' own use of the redemptive-historical hermenutic when interpreting the OT.

Abner Chou arguesa that this use of Hosea was not intended to impose any additional meaning onto the text of the OT passage cited.[p130][bib:chou2016] Instead, he claims that Matthew's use of this passage is intended to draw out a parallel between his account and Hosea's. Hosea himself drew a parallel between the exodus from Egypt and a future restoration: "They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the Lord."[^3] Just as Hosea used the exodus in anticipation of a future restoration, says Chou, Matthew is using Christ's own exodus from Egypt in anticipation of the restoration that He will bring His people.

I do not believe this explanation to be satisfying because of the language used by Matthew: "This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord". A parallel may request reflection, but only a prophecy commands fulfillment.

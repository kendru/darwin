- FoundationDB uses their own "programming language" (sounds like a C++ preprocessor)
  to enable coroutines for single-threaded concurrency in C++. [FoundationDB or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Trust the Database (Markus Pilman, Snowflake)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJb8A6h9jQQ)

### Slogan idea for HTAP database:

Transactions at the speed of demand;
Analytics at the speed of thought.

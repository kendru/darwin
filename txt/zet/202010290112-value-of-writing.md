# The Value of Writing

<!--
The outline ended up being formulated in terms of questions and answers.
I do not know if there is any significance to this.
-->

- Why write?
    - Think more clearly
    - Retain information
    - Healthy habit
    - Produce information that could be of general usefulness
- What do I like to write?
    - Technical documention
- What should I write?
    - Finish Learn ClojureScript - committment
    - Some creative writing - strech myself
    - Study and devotional notes - good to come back to, knowledge retention
    - Small development/technical notes - useful without demanding too much time
        - Best medium for publishing? blog, zet in this repo, microblogging platform, custom tool?
- What do I need to be successful with writing?
    - Block of time without distraction
    - Ideas
    - Live with drafts that are not perfect

I'll keep the outline for now so that I can reference it and so that I can see

There have been several occasions over the past few weeks that have brought to mind
the usefulness of writing. Some of the inspiration has come from reading Hillel Wayne's
newsletter. Some of it has come from working at a company that is fostering a strong wiki
culture and thoughtful written communication. Some has come from my own conviction that
writing is a useful tool for mental health.

Writing helps me to think more clearly. I often have a nascent idea that I am too lazy to
invest in developing. It is easy to get caught up _doing_ things without putting too
much thought into them. When writing, there is nowhere to hide from an undeveloped thought
or an obviously faulty line of thinking. To put an idea into writing, one must commit
that idea to a higher degree of consideration that is required in casual thought.

Writing also helps to retain information. Hearing and watching are two passive forms of
ingesting information. Reading requires some additional mental effort, but it is still
less active than writing. To write an idea requires more effort, and that effort leads
to better retention. Kahneman talks about our brains as operating in "System 1" - which
is the intuitive mode that takes over low-effort tasks - and "System 2" - which is the
more thoughful mode that must be enlisted for high-effort tasks.[][bib:kahneman2011]
By recruiting System 2, we incorporate the idea into our though process more thoroughly.

In addition to helping us think more clearlt and retain information better, writing is
a healthy habit.

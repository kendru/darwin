# Public Everything

_Public Everything_ (_PE_) is a development and operational philosophy which holds the belief that all services should be publicly accessible from the Internet and should perform their own authentication and authorization. In contrast to _defense in depth_, _public everything_  believes that the predominant philosophy of cloud security offers little additional security (compared to _PE_) and adds layers of complexity that make both development and operation of software overly burdensome.

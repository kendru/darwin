# Typesetting

## Principles

- ~66 characters per line is easiest to read.
- spine margin should usually be about half the size of fore-edge
  margin so that when viewed as a spread, the typeblock is roughly
  equidistant from edge and opposite typeblock.

## Terminology

- Verso: lefthand page
- Recto: righthand page
- Trim size: dimensions of final document
- Stock size: dimensions of paper that document is trimmed from
- Bleed size: distance between trim size and outer edge of where
  document may be cut - possibly physical dimension of paper.
- Typeblock: dimensions of area where text may be printed.
- Spine margin: distance from inner (spine) edge and typeblock.
- Fore-edge margin: distance from outer (fore-) edge and typeblock.

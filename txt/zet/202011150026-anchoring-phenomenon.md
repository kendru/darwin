# Anchoring Phenomenon

Anchoring is the phenomonon whereby the act of being presented with some number in one context affects our estimation of some measure - even in another context. For example, if I said that I would give you \$10, then I asked you how tall you thought the tallest person in the world was, your answer would be _closer_ to 10' than if I had not offer you the money beforehand.

Kahneman writes that the anchoring phenomenon can be dually explained by the suggestability of "System 1" and by the more thoughtful "System 2" process by which we start estimation at a familiar anchor and adjust our estimation until we are no longer confident that our estimate is moving in the right direction.[][bib:kahneman2011]
